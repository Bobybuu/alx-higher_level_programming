## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone:

### General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else`, and `if ... elif ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values using operators
* How to use `while` and `for` loops
* How to use the `range()` function
* How to use `break` and `continue` statements
* How to use `else` clauses on loops
* What the `pass` statement does and when to use it
* How to define and use functions
* What variable scope means
* Whatâ€™s the difference between `return` and `print`
* How to handle function arguments (default, non-default, `*args`, `**kwargs`)
* How to use function annotations
* Coding style (PEP 8) and best practices

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3 (version 3.8.10)`
* The first line of all your files should be: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
* All files must end with a new line
* No more than 5 lines of code without a function
* Each file should have a `README.md` and proper documentation using docstrings

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

Write a program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit

Print the last digit of a randomly generated number and state if it is greater than 5, zero, or less than 6 and not 0.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Print all lowercase letters except `q` and `e`.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Print lowercase alphabet in reverse with alternating uppercase.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing

Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

### 5. 00...99

Print numbers from 0 to 99 with leading zero formatting.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need.

Print all unique two-digit combinations.

### 7. islower

Write a function that checks for lowercase characters.

### 8. To uppercase

Write a function that converts a string to uppercase.

### 9. Print last digit

Write a function that prints and returns the last digit of a number.

### 10. a + b

Function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b

Function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.

### 12. FizzBuzz

Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print `Fizz`, for multiples of 5 print `Buzz`, and for both print `FizzBuzz`.

## Advanced Tasks (Optional)

### 13. Insert score

Insert text into the body of another file based on conditions.

### 14. Smile in the mirror

Write a program that prints the alphabet in reverse without using a string literal.

### 15. Remove at position

Remove a character at a specified position in a string.
