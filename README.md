# 🐍 ALX Python Learning Path

At **ALX**, Python is taught as a foundational programming language, especially for **backend development**, **automation**, **scripting**, and **data manipulation**. It’s introduced early in the **ALX Software Engineering Program** after students gain low-level programming experience through **C programming**.

### 2. Data Types and Structures
- Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Type casting and type checking

### 3. Control Flow
- `if`, `else`, `elif` statements
- `for` and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`

### 4. Functions
- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters, arguments, `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Recursion and lambda functions

### 5. Data Manipulation
- String and list operations
- Working with files (`open()`, reading, writing)
- Using `with` for context management

### 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- `__init__` constructor
- Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation

### 7. Pythonic Practices
- List comprehensions
- Ternary operations
- Use of `enumerate()` and `zip()`

### 8. Modules and Packages
- Importing standard and custom modules
- Using modules like `sys`, `os`, `random`, `datetime`, etc.

### 9. Exception Handling
- `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
- Creating and using custom exceptions

### 10. Testing and Debugging
- Writing tests using `unittest` or `doctest`
- Debugging with `pdb`

# ⚡ JavaScript at ALX

JavaScript is introduced at **ALX** after learners have built a solid foundation in **C** and **Python**. It plays a key role in **web development**, especially for building **dynamic frontend interfaces**, **interacting with the DOM**, and handling **asynchronous programming**. It’s also used to teach concepts in **event handling**, **testing**, and **modular programming**.

---

## ✅ Key Topics in JavaScript at ALX

### 1. Introduction to JavaScript
- Interpreted scripting language
- Writing and running JS scripts
- Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Comments and basic syntax

### 2. Data Types and Structures
- Numbers, strings, booleans
- Arrays, objects
- Type conversion and coercion

### 3. Control Structures
- `if`, `else`, `switch`
- `for`, `while`, `do...while`
- `break`, `continue`

### 4. Functions
- Declaring and invoking functions
- Function expressions and arrow functions
- Closures and higher-order functions

### 5. The DOM (Document Object Model)
- Selecting elements with `getElementById`, `querySelector`
- Changing HTML and CSS via JS
- Creating and deleting elements dynamically

### 6. Events
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- Event propagation (bubbling and capturing)
- Common events (`click`, `submit`, `load`, `keydown`, etc.)

### 7. Objects and Prototypes
- Creating objects
- `this` keyword
- Prototypes and inheritance

### 8. ES6+ Features
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread/rest operators
- `let`/`const` vs `var`
- Classes and modules

### 9. Asynchronous JavaScript
- Callbacks
- Promises
- `async` / `await`

### 10. Testing and Debugging
- Console methods (`console.log`, `console.error`)
- Browser DevTools
- Writing simple test cases
